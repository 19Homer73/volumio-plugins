	VOLUMIO SPOTIFY CONNECT PLUGIN

For armv7+ (Rpi 2, Rpi 3, etc, but not Rpi 1/Rpi Zero) devices only for now

This plugin is designed to use Spotify connect web with volumio
Base on this work : https://github.com/Fornoth/spotify-connect-web

To start it is a very basic plugin.
It just allow you tou install and configure spotify connect-web in Volumio 2
It will not (for the moment) display album art, title or allow changing track from volumio.
But from a external device and the offcial Spotify app, you'll be able to send your music to your device.
