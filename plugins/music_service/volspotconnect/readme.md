	VOLUMIO SPOTIFY CONNECT PLUGIN

IMPORTANT

- Requires a Premium or Family account


IMPORTANT 2

- Now the plugin works with armv6 RPI (previvous to RPI 2) even if just tested on RPI B...And of course with armv7 device (RPI 2, RPI3, Sparky ) 

- Version for armV6 requires a chroot system (11Mo). Installation may be long...10min! Be patient !	

This plugin is designed to use Spotify connect web with volumio
Base on this work : https://github.com/Fornoth/spotify-connect-web
With the great work of ashthespy for the webUI integration!
Thank you to all developpers !

To start, it is a very basic plugin.
It just allow you tou install and configure spotify connect-web in Volumio 2
It will not (for the moment) display album art, title or allow changing track from volumio.
But from a external device and the offcial Spotify app, you'll be able to send your music to your device.

- This version supports Family account : every member can use the device !


To install
- You only need to download volspotconnect.zip. Take care to download the "raw" file, not only html from github...
- From Volumio UI choose "plugins" in setting, then "upload plugin" and select the file you have downloaded
- First start may take several seconds, especially with armv6 because the chroot structure is built a this moment.
